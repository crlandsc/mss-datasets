#   2. Go to https://zenodo.org/account/settings/applications/
#   3. Create a "Personal access token" with deposit:read scope
#
# Step 2: Request access (must be approved by dataset owners)
#   Visit BOTH pages while logged in and click "Request access":
#   - MedleyDB v1: https://zenodo.org/records/1649325
#   - MedleyDB v2: https://zenodo.org/records/1715175
#   Wait for approval — may take hours or days.
#
# Step 3: Paste your token below & uncomment the line
# ZENODO_TOKEN=your_token_here
