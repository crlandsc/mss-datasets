# MedleyDB override rules — curated exclusions for stems/tracks
# whose audio content doesn't match the routed stem category.
#
# Reviewed manually by listening to each stem. See review_list.md for details.

# Tracks excluded entirely (excessive stem bleed across all stems)
exclude_tracks:
  - HopsNVinyl_ChickenFriedSteak
  - HopsNVinyl_HoneyBrown
  - HopsNVinyl_ReignCheck
  - HopsNVinyl_WidowsWalk
  - Karachacha_Volamos

# Individual stems excluded per track.
# Key = track directory name, value = list of stem keys (e.g. S01, S06).
# These stems contain audio that doesn't match the target category
# (e.g., vocals in "sampler" routed to other, guitar in "fx/processed sound").
